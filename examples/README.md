# Example bpm setup files

These are my bpm config files. You can use them as an example for the format
to put yours in.

bpmPlugins.txt is fine to copy into your Beat Saber folder. bpm.json is not! bpm
uses that file to determine what versions your mods are on. Only use this bpm.json
as an example of the format.
