# Legacy codebase

The code in /FullAuto/ is **not** maintained, and you probably not edit it or
make pull requests to fix bugs in it. It's the old code for bpm in C#, and it's
not supported or used in any builds. It's here in case anyone wants to read
about how the original loader worked.

bpm is now built from the source in the /client/ directory at the root of the
repo. To build bpm for yourself, use the ```npm run build``` command in the client
directory.
